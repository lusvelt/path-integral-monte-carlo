IMPORTANT:
- Compute the z value at the end of anharmonic-oscillator.ipynb
- Document private methods, at least comment them
- Plot the error (or say something about it) in propagators-computation.ipynb
- Parallelize the calculations of the points in propagators-computation.ipynb
- Explain better what we are doing in all jupyter notebooks
- Write tests
- Implement lattice QCD

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Compute metropolis average acceptance rate to get eps parameter (optimal at 50% acceptance rate)
