IMPORTANT:
- Document that functionals should be decorated with @njit
- Document also private methods, at least comment them
- Explain better what we are doing (in all jupyter notebooks)
- Comment all the code, use Copilot for help
- Refactor static-quark-potential.ipynb
- See why the fits in static-quark-potential.ipynb are not so good

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Refactor compute_G and plot()
- Compute metropolis average acceptance rate to get eps parameter (optimal at 50% acceptance rate)
