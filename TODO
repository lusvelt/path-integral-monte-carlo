IMPORTANT:
- Compute the z value at the end of anharmonic-oscillator.ipynb
- See if the expected Delta E should still be 1.933 even after the O(a^2) corrections to the potential
- Refactor compute_G and plot()
- Document also private methods, at least comment them
- Explain better what we are doing (in all jupyter notebooks)
- Plot the error (or say something about it) in propagators-computation.ipynb
- Parallelize the calculations of the points in propagators-computation.ipynb
- Write tests for all public functions
- Implement lattice QCD

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Compute metropolis average acceptance rate to get eps parameter (optimal at 50% acceptance rate)
