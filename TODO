IMPORTANT:
- Document that functionals should be decorated with @njit
- Document also private methods, at least comment them
- Explain better what we are doing (in all jupyter notebooks)
- Plot the error (or say something about it) in propagators-computation.ipynb
- Add axes labels in propagators-computation.ipynb
- Write tests for all public functions
- Implement lattice QCD

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Refactor compute_G and plot()
- Compute metropolis average acceptance rate to get eps parameter (optimal at 50% acceptance rate)
